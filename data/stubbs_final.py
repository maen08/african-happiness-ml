# FINAL PROJECT: DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM

#
# PROGRAM TITLE: 2020 AFRICA HAPPINESS FINAL DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM
#
#
# PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: A modularized Python program that provides the user with several options to choose 
#                      from to showcase all of the data performed on the Google Forms survey and 2020 World 
#                      Happiness Report data set. This program produces relevant data computations, pivot 
#                      tables and visualizations that are relevant to the 2020 Africa Happiness topic and the 
#                      posed data-driven questions on this topic. The user is able to choose between EIGHT 
#                      options viewing the following: an overview of the topic and data set, data-driven 
#                      questions and predictions, basic data statistics, simple data visualizations, survey 
#                      analysis, data set analysis and findings and observations to the data-driven questions. 
#                      The EIGHTH option allows the user to quit the program. 
#
#
# GENERAL SOLUTION: This program breaks down the tasks required for this program into several functions including:
#
#                   findings: outputs the findings and observations to the data-driven questions using data 
#                             statistics, pivot tables and summary statistics, and visualizations as supporting

    print('Prediction: Happiness Scores are national average responses to questions of life evaluation. Getting this data is important because it helps remind policy makers and people in power that happiness is based on social capital, not just finanacial. These data results are an essential and useful way to guide public policies and measure their effectiveness. From initial interaction with the original data set, Israel was names as a country that is in Africa. After deeper research, it was found that Israel is actually apart of Asia. The initial prediction was that Israel ranked the happiest in 2020 but the country in Africa that actually ranked the happiest in 2020 in Mauritius.\n')

A survey was created on this topic to determine which Africa country was the happiest based on respondents observations or opinions. The survey asked: Which African country do you think had the highest happiness rank in 2020?. The four options given were Israel, Mauritius, South Sudan and Ethiopia. The option of Israel was a mistake on my part since I did not realize that Israel is actually in Asia. Taking this into count, I visually inspected and cleaned the data set in excel by researching where each country is located by continent. Based on these findings, I cleaned the data set in excel by properly stating the continent of each country in the data set.')

This question was formed based off that observation. The prediction made was that higher social support scores result in higher happiness scores.\n')

I decided to use some of my skills from statistics and perform a bit of correlation analysis. Since R-squared is 0.143, approximately 14% of the variability in happiness scores is being explained by social support scores. From this we can draw that the model doesnâ€™t  really do a good job of explaining the variation of happiness scores in social support scores.\n")

It was observed that South Sudan ranked the lowest and Mauritius ranked the highest in happiness. It was drawn that South Sudan had a lower score in freedom to make life choices while Mauritius scored higher. From this, the predicition that was made is that high happiness scores are a result of higher freedom to make life choices scores. The prediciton is that more freedom to make life choices makes a country happy.\n')

This is very close to 0%, which represents a model that does not explain any of the variation in the response variable around its mean. From this we can conclude that freedom to make life choices is not a good variable to explain happiness scores.

The healthy life expectancy column is based on Healthy life expectancies at birth, based on the data extracted from the World Health Organizationâ€™s (WHO) Global Health Observatory data repository. By comparing the healthy life expectancy scores between Mauritius and South Sudan, it was predicted that there is a positive relationship between happiness scores and healthy life expectancies. Higher happiness scores appear where there is higher healthy life expectancy.\n")

    print("I took extra time to create a scatter visualization in excel to observe this relationship deeper. The returned R-squared value was 0.091. This means that only 9% of the variability in happiness scores is explained by healthy life expectancy. This leads me to conclude that it is better to consider all of the variables (columns) instead of trying to draw which best predicts a countryâ€™s happiness score.\n")

These results are drawn from running a multiple linear regression on a model that only includes happiness scores, social support, healthy life expectancy, perceptions of corruption, freedom to make life choices, and generosity. The outputted adjusted R-squared value was 0.1512, therefore, giving us a 15% variability.")
    print("")
    print("I decided to take it a step further and create more models between happiness scores and just one explanatory variable (social support, healthy life expectancy, perceptions of corruption, freedom to make life choices, or generosity). From this, it was found that social support has the highest adjusted R-squared value of 0.1223. This means that 12% of the variation in Happiness scores is being explained by social support. We can assume that social support is the best predictor of the results for Africaâ€™s happiness scores.")
    print("")
    print("To analyze further, a correlation matrix was created in Python between happiness scores, social support, healthy life expectancy, perceptions of corruption, freedom to make life choices, and generosity. Even though there werenâ€™t any high correlations, the strongest correlation was between social support and happiness scores with a value of 0.38. This means that social support is more conditioning to the happiness score more than any other variable in the data set. Furthermore, happiness in Africa is related to people having relatives and/or friends that they can count on when they need help.")

Getting this data is important because it helps remind policy makers and people in power that happiness is based on social capital, not just finanacial. These data results are an essential and useful way to guide public policies and measure their effectiveness. From initial interaction with the original data set, Israel was names as a country that is in Africa. After deeper research, it was found that Israel is actually apart of Asia. The initial prediction was that Israel ranked the happiest in 2020 but the country in Africa that actually ranked the happiest in 2020 in Mauritius.\n')

It was observed that South Sudan ranked the lowest and Mauritius ranked the highest in happiness. It was drawn that South Sudan had a lower score in freedom to make life choices while Mauritius scored higher. From this, the predicition that was made is that high happiness scores are a result of higher freedom to make life choices scores. The prediciton is that more freedom to make life choices makes a country happy.\n')

The healthy life expectancy column is based on Healthy life expectancies at birth, based on the data extracted from the World Health Organizationâ€™s (WHO) Global Health Observatory data repository. By comparing the healthy life expectancy scores between Mauritius and South Sudan, it was predicted that there is a positive relationship between happiness scores and healthy life expectancies. Higher happiness scores appear where there is higher healthy life expectancy.\n")
